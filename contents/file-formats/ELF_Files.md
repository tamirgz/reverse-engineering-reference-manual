#### *<p align='center'> ELF File Header </p>*
---
* Starts at offset 0 and is the roadmap that describes the rest of the file. It marks the ELF type, architecture, execution entry point, and offsets to program headers and section headers

---
#### *<p align='center'> Program Header Table </p>*
---
* Let the system knows how to create the process image. It contains an array of structures, each describing a segment. A segment contains one or more sections

---
#### *<p align='center'> Section Header Table </p>*
---
* Is not necessary for program execution. It is mainly for linking and debugging purposes. It is an array of __ELF_32Shdr__ or __ELF_64Shdr__ structures (Section Header)
  * __.got (Global Offset Table) Section__: a table of addresses located in the data section. It allows PIC (Position Independent) code to reference data that were not available during compilation (ex: extern "var"). That data will have a section in .got, which will then be filled in later by the dynamic linker
  * __.plt (Procedure Linkage Table) Section__: contains within the text segment, consisting of external function entries. Each plt entry has a correcponding entry in .got.plt which contains the actual offset to the function
    * plt entry consists of: 
      + A jump to an address specified in GOT
      + argument to tell the resolver which function to resolve (only reach there during function's first invocation)
      + call the resolver (resides at PLT entry 0)
  * __.got.plt Section__: contains dynamically-linked function entries that can be resolved lazily through lazy binding. This means that it doesn't resolve the address until the function is called

#### *<p align='center'> Useful Compilation Options To Know For GCC </p>*
---
* __Useful Compilation Options To Know For GCC__:
  * __-g__: the compiled binary will contain extra sections with names that start with .debug_. The most important one of the .debug section is .debug_info. It tells you the path of the source file, path of the compilation directory, version of C used, and the line numbers where variables are declared in source code. It will also contain the parameter names for local functions
  * __-s__: the compiled binary will not contain symbol table and relocation information. This means that the .symtab will be stripped away, which contains references to variable and local function names
  * __-O3__: the second highest optimization level. The optimizations that it applied will actually result in bigger overall file size than the compiled version of the unoptimized binary
  * __-funroll-loops__: unroll the looping structure of any loops, making it harder for reverse engineer to analyze the compiled binary

---
#### *<p align='center'> Stripped Binary </p>*
---
* There are 2 sections that contain symbols: .dynsym and .symtab. .dynsym contains dynamic/global symbols, those symbols are resolved at runtime. .symtab contains all the symbols
  * __nm command__ to list all symbols in the binary from .symtab
  * Stripped binary == no .symtab symbol table
  * .dynsym symbol table cannot be stripped since it is needed for runtime, so imported library functions' symbols remain in a stripped binary. But if a binary is compiled only with statically-linked libraries, it will contain no symbol table at all if stripped
  * With non-stripped, gdb can identify local function names and knows the bounds of all functions so we can do this: disas &lt;function name&gt;
  * With stripped binary, gdb can’t even identify main. We can still try to identify main from the entry point using the command: __info file__. Also, can’t use disas since gdb does not know the bounds of a functions so it does not know which address range should be disassembled. Solution: use examine(x) command on address pointed by pc register like: __x/14i $pc__

* __Useful Tools To Analyze ELF File__: 
  + display section headers: __readelf -S &lt;file&gt;__
  + display program headers and section to segment mapping: __readelf -l &lt;file&gt;__
  + display symbol tables: __readelf --syms &lt;file&gt;__ or __objdump -t &lt;file&gt;__
  + display a section's content: __objdump -s -j &lt;section name&gt; &lt;file&gt;__
  + trace library call: __ltrace -f &lt;file&gt;__
  + trace sys call: __strace -f &lt;file&gt;__
  + decompile: check out __https://retdec.com/__
  + view a running program's process address space: __/proc/$pid/maps__
