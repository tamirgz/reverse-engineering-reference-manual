#### *<p align='center'> PVM (Python Virtual Machine) </p>*

* __PVM (Python Virtual Machine)__ is a stack-based virtual machine that stores operands in an upwardly-growing stack
  * In stack-based execution, an operation is performed by popping operands from the stack, operates on them, and then storing the result back to the stack
  * __Advantages of Stack-Based Virtual Machine__
    * Instructions are shorter than instructions in register-based virtual machine since operands don’t need to be explicitly stated because they are on the stack, thus resulting in shorter overall bytecode 
    * Easier to implement since it doesn’t have to worry about register allocation

* __The 3 Tuples Associated With Function Object__
  * Local variables and parameters are stored in &lt;object name&gt;.`__code__`.co_varnames
  * Global variables that it uses are stored in &lt;object name&gt;.`__code__`.co_names
  * Constants it uses are stored in &lt;object name&gt;.`__code__`.co_consts

#### *<p align='center'> Python Bytecode Instructions </p>*
---
* __Python Bytecode Instructions__ 
  * For full instruction set, check out the [Official Python Documentation](https://docs.python.org/2/library/dis.html)
  * An instruction consists of an opcode and possibly an oparg. Opcode is the instruction and oparg is the index that resolves to the actual operands
    * Some instructions, such as BINARY_ADD, doesn't require an oparg since the operands it needs are on the stack 
    * Other instructions, such as those for LOAD/STORE, require an oparg to index a tuple for the operand. The specific tuple is referenced in the latter half of the opcode
      * __LOAD/STORE_CONST__: uses oparg to index the &lt;object name&gt;.`__code__`.co_consts tuple 
      * __LOAD/STORE_FAST__: uses oparg to index the &lt;object name&gt;.`__code__`.co_varnames tuple
      * __LOAD/STORE_GLOBAL__: uses oparg to index the &lt;object name&gt;.`__code__`.co_names tuple
      * Load will push the value it indexed onto the stack and store will store the value at the top of the stack into the indexed object
